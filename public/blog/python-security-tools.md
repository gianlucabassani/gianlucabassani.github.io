# SAMPLE - Building Custom Security Tools with Python

Python is an excellent language for developing security tools due to its simplicity and extensive library ecosystem. This post covers the fundamentals of creating your own security testing tools.

## Why Python for Security Tools?

- **Rapid Development**: Quick prototyping and iteration
- **Rich Libraries**: Extensive collection of networking, cryptography, and web libraries
- **Community Support**: Large community with security-focused libraries
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Essential Libraries

### Requests
For HTTP operations and web testing:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://example.com')
print(response.status_code)
```

### Scapy
For network packet manipulation:

```python
from scapy.all import *

packet = IP(dst="example.com")/ICMP()
send(packet)
```

### Paramiko
For SSH operations:

```python
import paramiko

ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
ssh.connect('hostname', username='user', password='pass')
```

## Building a Simple Port Scanner

Here's a basic example of a TCP port scanner:

```python
import socket
import sys
from datetime import datetime

def scan_port(target, port):
    try:
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        sock.settimeout(1)
        result = sock.connect_ex((target, port))
        sock.close()
        return result == 0
    except:
        return False

def main():
    target = sys.argv[1]
    print(f"Scanning {target}")
    
    for port in range(1, 1001):
        if scan_port(target, port):
            print(f"Port {port}: Open")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Always include proper error handling
2. **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging
3. **Configuration**: Use configuration files for settings
4. **Documentation**: Document your code thoroughly
5. **Testing**: Write unit tests for your functions

## Conclusion

Creating custom security tools with Python allows you to tailor solutions to specific needs and automate repetitive tasks. Start with simple scripts and gradually build more complex tools as your skills develop.
