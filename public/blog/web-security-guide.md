# SAMPLE - Getting Started with Web Application Security Testing

Web application security testing is a crucial skill for cybersecurity professionals. This guide will walk you through the fundamentals of identifying and exploiting common web vulnerabilities.

## Essential Tools

### Burp Suite
The industry standard for web application security testing. Key features include:
- Proxy for intercepting requests
- Scanner for automated vulnerability detection
- Intruder for brute force attacks
- Repeater for manual testing

### OWASP ZAP
A free alternative to Burp Suite with similar functionality.

## Common Vulnerabilities

### SQL Injection
One of the most dangerous web vulnerabilities that allows attackers to manipulate database queries.

```sql
-- Example payload
' OR 1=1 --
```

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

```html
<!-- Example payload -->
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

## Testing Methodology

1. **Reconnaissance** - Gather information about the target
2. **Mapping** - Understand the application's structure
3. **Discovery** - Find potential entry points
4. **Exploitation** - Test for vulnerabilities
5. **Reporting** - Document findings and recommendations

## Conclusion

Web application security testing requires a systematic approach and continuous learning. Practice on legal platforms like DVWA, WebGoat, and HackTheBox to improve your skills.
