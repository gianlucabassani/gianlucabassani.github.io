## Why I Started This Blog

The cybersecurity field is constantly evolving, and like many, I believe one of the best ways to learn is by teaching and documenting my process. This blog is my way to:  

- Share writeups from labs, CTFs, and penetration testing challenges.  
- Showcase open-source tools and projects I’m building.  
- Provide tutorials, tips, and learning resources that have helped me level up.

## My Approach to Cybersecurity

Since I started with PortSwigger labs a year ago, I’ve changed my mind many times about the best way to learn cybersecurity. Right now, I believe there isn’t a single best approach—the key is to stay curious, explore the world around you, and keep learning through hands-on exercises.  
I plan to write a dedicated post about how I started from zero knowledge in penetration testing and went all-in.
